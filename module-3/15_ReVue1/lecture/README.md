# te-bugs

Our goal is to revue Vue.js (get it???) by making a bug management app storing all bugs in Vuex for now.

## Data Object

A sample bug object should look like this:

```js
{
    id: 1,
    title: 'Help, a bug is in the elevator!',
    description: 'Oh no! It\'s getting closer! Please help me!!!',
    priority: 4,
    isOpen: true,
    resolution: ''
}
```
